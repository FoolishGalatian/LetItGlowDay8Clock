This code is an extension of "The PiHut Let it Glow Maker Advent Cabin" project for Day 8 (https://thepihut.com/blogs/raspberry-pi-tutorials/let-it-glow-maker-advent-calendar-day-8-rainbow-ring).

It is code that uses a 12-LED addressable RGB Ring to make a rudiementary clock. The clock uses 3 LED's on the ring to represent the hour (green), minute (red), and second (blue) hands on a clock. Since there are only 12 lights on the ring, the second hand updates every 5 seconds and the minute hand updates every 5 minutes, so I would not use it to make your next event, or you might be late.
